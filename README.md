LSTM Model (https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020SW002589), the Burton equation (https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/1998JA000437), our previous work (https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2021SW002748) and the persistence model

- predictions_SYM-H_1hour_swics.csv: SYM-H index one hour ahead forecasts made by the Model 1 of the paper. Missing values of SWEPAM are filled using SWICS.

- predictions_SYM-H_2hour_swics.csv: SYM-H index two hours ahead forecasts made by the Model 2 of the paper. Missing values of SWEPAM are filled using SWICS.

- predictions_SYM-H_1hour_no_swics.csv: SYM-H index one hour ahead forecasts made by the Model 3 of the paper. Missing values of SWEPAM are linearly interpolated.

- predictions_SYM-H_2hour_no_swics.csv: SYM-H index two hours ahead forecasts made by the Model 4 of the paper. Missing values of SWEPAM are linearly interpolated.

- predictions_SYM-H_1hour_swics_on_no_swics.csv: SYM-H index one hour ahead forecast made by Model 1 on Model 3's test data. Corresponding to scenario 5 of the paper. 

- predictions_SYM-H_2hour_swics_on_no_swics.csv: SYM-H index two hours ahead forecast made by Model 2 on Model 4's test data. Corresponding to scenario 6 of the paper.
